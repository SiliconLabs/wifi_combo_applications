# BLE Privacy

## 1. Purpose / Scope

Bluetooth LE supports a feature that reduces the ability to track an LE device over a period of time by changing the Bluetooth device address on a frequent basis, called Privacy of that particular device.

The device address of the remote device referred to as the private address will be resolved by local device in order to connect to that device. The private address is generated by using Identity Resolving Key (IRK) exchange in between devices during SMP bonding procedure. Our local device will add the remote devices in one Resolving list(to maintain remote device identity addresses) along with that IRK's and enable the Resolution, sets privacy mode and connect to the remote device with remote identity address.

User has to follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application.

### 5.1 Loading the RS9116W Firmware

Refer [Getting started with PC ](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware binary is located in `<SDK>/firmware/`


### 5.2 Building the Application on the Host Platform

### 5.2.1 Using STM32

Refer [STM32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/)  

- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippets/ble/ble_privacy/projects/ble_privacy-nucleo-f411re.uvprojx` in Keil IDE.
- Build and Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
	- If RESET pin is connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
	- If RESET pin is not connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**


#### 5.2.2 Using EFX32

Refer [EFx32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/), for settin-up EFR & EFM host platforms

- Import the EFR32/EFM32 project from `<SDK>/examples/snippets/ble/ble_privacy/projects`
    - Select the appropriate .slsproj as per Radio Board type mentioned in **Section 3.3** for EFR32 board.
   (or)
    - Select the *.brd2204a-gg11.slsproj  for EFM32GG11 board.

- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**

### 5.3 Common Steps

1. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will be in Scanning state.

2. Advertise remote device,

3. If Silicon Labs module get device with name configured RSI_BLE_LOCAL_NAME or bd address with address configured in RSI_BLE_REMOTE_ADDR  in results ,local device will try to connect with remote device.

4. After connection Silicon Labs device which is in central mode will initiate SMP request

5. Give response from Remote device and passkey

6. After successful SMP connection security keys will exchanged between Remote device and Silicon Labs device.

7. Silicon Labs device will add remote device's IRK's and local IRK's in to resolve list and enable resolution

8. Give disconnect from remote device and keep in advertise mode.

9. Now Silicon Labs module will try to connect to remote device with identity address.

10. After successful connection, Silicon Labs module will give start encryption instead of SMP repairing.

11. Encryption will be enabled on both sides.

12. After successful program execution, if Silcon Labs device connects to the remote BLE central device the prints in teraterm looks as shown below.
