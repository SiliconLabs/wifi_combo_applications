## BT SPP Master Tera Term Script
This example demonstrates how to configure the RS9116W in BT SPP Master mode to establish a SPP profile connection with a remote mobile device. Once connected, data can be exchanged between the two BT devices over SPP. This example uses an Android mobile device running a Bluetooth SPP Manager app. An example [Bluetooth SPP Manager App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.rtcmanager) is available from the Google Play store. To learn how to use the app, see [Using the Bluetooth SPP Manager App](#using-the-bluetooth-spp-manager-app). 

Before continuing, ensure the RS9116 EVK is plugged into your computer and Tera Term is connected as described in [Getting Started with PC using AT Commands](http://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-pc/). 

**STEP 1.** Reset the RS9116 EVK.

**STEP 2.** In the Tera Term menu, select `Control->Macro`.

**STEP 3.** Navigate to the folder `<SDK>/examples/at_commands/teraterm/bt_spp_master` and select the file `spp_master.ttl`.

At startup, the RS9116W is configured using the following commands:
  1. Opermode
  2. Set connectable mode
  3. Set discoverable mode
  4. Set profile mode
  5. Set local name

**STEP 4.** Configure the mobile device as a Bluetooth SPP slave, refer to the [Bluetooth SPP Manager App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.rtcmanager) documentation.

**STEP 5.** Ensure the mobile device is in connectable mode, then enter the BD address of the mobile device in the format `AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF`.

Note that the mobile BD address is available from the device settings page which is typically at:
  - `Settings -> About phone -> All spec -> Status -> Bluetooth Address`
  - `Settings -> About phone -> Status -> Bluetooth Address`

**STEP 6.** After the 'bond response' and 'link key' request event appears in Tera Term, a popup appears. Choose the 'User link key response' then select OK.

The mobile app is now paired with the RS9116W.

**STEP 9** In the Tera Term popup, choose the 'SPP Connect' command' The `AT+RSIBT_SPPCONNECTED` event appears in the Term Term window to indicate that the SPP connection was successful. Data can now be sent between the RS9116W and the mobile app.
