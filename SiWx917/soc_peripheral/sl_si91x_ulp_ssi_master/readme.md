## Purpose/Scope

- This application demonstrate the use of ULP SSI MASTER for data transfer in full duplex as well as half duplex mode in master mode.
- This application can run in synchronous mode with full-duplex operation
  - Master transmits data on MOSI pin and receives the same data on MISO pin
- This also supports send and receive data with any SSI slave, additionally it also supports DMA and non-DMA transfer.
- For half duplex communication, i.e., send and receive, master / slave connection is required.

## Overview

- SSI (Synchronous Serial Interface) is a synchronous, point-to-point, serial communication channel for digital data transmission.
- Synchronous data transmission is one in which the data is transmitted by synchronizing the transmission at the receiving and sending ends using a common clock signal.
- SSI is a synchronous four-wire interface consisting of two data pins(MOSI, MISO), a device select pin (CSN) and a gated clock pin(SCLK).
- With the two data pins, it allows for full-duplex operation with other SSI compatible devices.
- It supports full duplex Single-bit SPI master mode.
- It supports 6 modes:  
  - Mode 0: Clock Polarity is zero and Clock Phase is zero.
  - Mode 1: Clock Polarity is zero, Clock Phase is one.
  - Mode 2: Clock Polarity is one and Clock Phase is zero.
  - Mode 3: Clock Polarity is one and Clock Phase is one.
  - Mode-4: TEXAS_INSTRUMENTS SSI.
  - Mode-5: NATIONAL_SEMICONDUCTORS_MICROWIRE.
- The SPI clock is programmable to meet required baud rates
- It can generates interrupts for different events like transfer complete, data lost, mode fault.
- It supports up to 32K bytes of read data from a SSI device in a single read operation.
- It has support for DMA (Dynamic Memory Access).
- The ULP_SSI_MST in the MCU ULP peripherals supports Single-bit mode and can be connected to only one slave.

## About Example Code

- This example demonstrates SSI transfer i.e., full duplex communication and SSI send, SSI receive i.e., half duplex communication.
- Various parameters like SSI clock mode, bit-width, manual cs pin and SSI baudrate can be configured using UC. Also, Master or Slave or ULP Master DMA can be configured using UC.
- sl_si91x_ssi_config.h file contains the control configurations and sl_si91x_ssi_common_config.h contains DMA configuration selection.
- In the example code, first the output buffer is filled with some data which is transferred to the slave.
- Firmware version of API is fetched using \ref sl_si91x_ssi_get_version which includes release version, major version and minor version \ref sl_ssi_version_t.
- A static function is called to fill in the \ref sl_ssi_clock_config_t structure, which is passed in \ref sl_si91x_ssi_configure_clock API to configure the clock.
- \ref sl_si91x_ssi_init is used to initialize the peripheral, that includes pin configuration and it powers up the module.
- SSI instance must be passed in init to get the instance handle \ref sl_ssi_instance_t, which is used in other APIs.
- After initialization \ref sl_si91x_ssi_configure_power_mode is called to set the power mode \ref sl_ssi_power_state_t.
- All the necessary parameters are configured using \ref sl_si91x_ssi_set_configuration API, it expects a structure with required parameters \ref sl_ssi_control_config_t.
- After configuration, a callback register API is called to register the callback at the time of events \ref sl_si91x_ssi_register_event_callback.
- The State machine code is implemented for transfer, send and receive data, the current mode is determined by ssi_mode_enum_t which is declared in ulp_ssi_master_example.c file.
- According to the macro which is enabled, the example code executes the transfer of data:

- If **ULP_SSI_MASTER_TRANSFER** macro is enabled, it will transfer the data, i.e. send and receive data in full duplex mode.

  - The current_mode enum is set to ULP_SSI_MASTER_TRANSFER_DATA and calls the \ref sl_si91x_ssi_transfer_data API which expects data_out, data_in and number of data bytes to be transferred for sending and receiving data simultaneously (full duplex).
  - This test can also be performed in loopback state, i.e. connect MISO and MOSI pins.
  - The example code waits till the transfer is completed, when the transfer complete event is generated, it compares the sent and received data.
  - The result is printed on the console.
  - Now the current_mode enum is updated as per the macros enabled i.e., either ULP_SSI_MASTER_SEND or ULP_SSI_MASTER_RECEIVE.
  - If no other macros are enabled, the current_mode is updated to ULP_SSI_MASTER_TRANSMISSION_COMPLETED.

- If **ULP_SSI_MASTER_RECEIVE** macro is enabled, it only receives the data from slave - SPI slave must be connected, it cannot be tested in loopback mode.

  - The current_mode is set to the ULP_SSI_MASTER_RECEIVE_DATA and calls the \ref sl_si91x_ssi_receive_data API which expects data_in (empty buffer) and number of data bytes to be received.
  - It waits till the receive is completed i.e., transfer complete event is generated.
  - Now the current_mode enum is updated as per the macros enabled i.e., ULP_SSI_MASTER_SEND.
  - If no other macros are enabled, the current_mode is updated to ULP_SSI_MASTER_TRANSMISSION_COMPLETED.

- If **ULP_SSI_MASTER_SEND** macro is enabled, it only sends the data to slave, SPI slave must be connected, it cannot be tested in loopback mode.
  - The current_mode enum is set to ULP_SSI_MASTER_SEND_DATA and calls the \ref sl_si91x_ssi_send_data API which expects data_out (data buffer that needs to be sent) and number of bytes to send.
  - It waits till the send is completed i.e., transfer complete event is generated.
  - Now the current_mode enum is updated to ULP_SSI_MASTER_TRANSMISSION_COMPLETED.
